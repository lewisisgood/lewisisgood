I'm a Data Enthusiast and Tech for Good Advocate with a passion for Python, Veganism, and Mindfulness. Through my work, I aim to use technology to make the world a better place while taking care of our planet and promoting self-awareness.

ðŸŒ± My Interests
Data & Python
As a data lover, I enjoy diving deep into datasets to uncover hidden insights and patterns. I'm a strong believer in the power of data-driven decision making and using Python to make sense of the world around us.

Tech for Good
I'm passionate about utilizing technology to create positive change in society. From developing accessible tools to empowering local communities, I strive to make a tangible impact on people's lives.

Veganism
I'm a proud vegan and an advocate for sustainable living. I aim to promote the adoption of plant-based diets as a way to reduce our environmental footprint and improve global health.

Mindfulness
I believe in the power of mindfulness to enhance our mental well-being and overall happiness. Through meditation and self-awareness, I aspire to foster a more compassionate and connected world.
