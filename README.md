I'm a Data Enthusiast and Tech for Good Advocate with a passion for Python, Veganism, and Mindfulness. Through my work, I aim to use technology to make the world a better place while taking care of our planet and promoting self-awareness.

🌱 My Interests
Data & Python
As a data lover, I enjoy diving deep into datasets to uncover hidden insights and patterns. I'm a strong believer in the power of data-driven decision making and using Python to make sense of the world around us.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

data = pd.read_csv('world_data.csv')
insights = data[data['tech_for_good'] == True]
sns.scatterplot(data=insights, x='impact', y='sustainability')
Tech for Good
I'm passionate about utilizing technology to create positive change in society. From developing accessible tools to empowering local communities, I strive to make a tangible impact on people's lives.

I believe in the power of mindfulness to enhance our mental well-being and overall happiness. Through meditation and self-awareness, I aspire to foster a more compassionate and connected world.
